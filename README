kwadrat lets you turn a set of images in a set of frames following the process used by Zbig Rybczynski when making the short film Kwadrat in 1972.
0) For every picture in the loop
1) Take a square picture of size l
    2) Build a grid of size l on top of the image
        3) For every (square) cell in the grid
            4) If the cell intersects part of the underlying image, draw a WHITE square
            5) If the cell does not intersect part of the underlying image, draw a BLACK square
    6) Change l to l/2
    7) Repeat from 2
